\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
%With the growing popularity of soft robotic systems, ensuring the trustworthiness of the soft grippers is crucial. 
Soft robotics is an emerging technology in which engineers create flexible devices for use in a variety of applications, such as surgery, prosthetics, space exploration and grocery picking. 
%Soft gripping is considered to be the most mature area in soft robotics, and to advance the adoption of soft robotic systems ensuring their trustworthiness is essential. 
Soft gripping is considered to be the most mature area in soft robotics, and to advance the adoption of soft robotics ensuring their trustworthiness is essential. 
\emph{Trust} may vary, as it can be gained and lost over time, and different research disciplines define trust in different ways. 
Autonomous systems (ASs) (e.g. soft robotic systems) are considered \emph{trustworthy} when the design, engineering, and operation of these systems generate positive outcomes and mitigate outcomes which can be harmful~\cite{Naiseh2022}.
Trustworthiness can be dependent on many factors such as: (i) explainability, accountability and understandability to different users; (ii) robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments; (iii) assurance of their design and operation through verification and validation (V\&V) activities; (iv) confidence in their ability to adapt their functionality as required; (v) security against attacks on the systems, users, and deployed environment; (vi) governance and regulation of their design and operation; and (vii) consideration of ethics and human values in their deployment and use~\cite{Naiseh2022}. 

There are various techniques for demonstrating trustworthiness of ASs, such as synthesis, formal verification at design-time, runtime verification or monitoring, and test-based methods \cite{Abeywickrama2022}. 
But, common to all these techniques is the need to formulate \emph{specifications}. 	
According to the ISO standard for systems and software engineering vocabulary~\cite{ISO24765:2017}, a \emph{specification} is a detailed formulation that provides a definitive description of a system for the purpose of developing or validating the system. 
However, the soft robotics community has so far provided very little attention to formulating specifications of soft robotic grippers where most existing works only describe some parameters of the end-effector (e.g. \cite{Hong2022,Bhattacharya2019,Tadakuma2020,Loh2014,Nishikawa2019,Mohan2020}).  

Meanwhile, \emph{verifiability} is considered key for improving trustworthiness, which can be achieved by considering verification early as an integral part during specification and system design \cite{Mousavi2022}. Verifiability will essentially lead to systems that are by their construction are worthy of our trust, and to this end, it can be promoted to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We provide an extensive specification to ensure trustworthiness of a soft gripper with requirements that are both functional as well as non-functional, such as reliability, safety, adaptability, predictability, ethics and regulation.
	\item We highlight the importance for promoting \emph{verifiability} as a first-class objective in the design of soft robotic grippers. 
\end{itemize}
We explore our study using a case study that involves pick-and-place task of grocery items using a recycled soft gripper \cite{Partridge2022}. 
%The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In Section~\ref{background-relatedwork}, we provide background information and related works to the present study. 
Section~\ref{specification-gripper} proposes a detailed specification of a soft gripper. 
Finally, Section~\ref{discussion-conclusions} provides a discussion of our study exploring verifiability, and conclusions.

\subsection{Background}\label{background}
\subsubsection{Recycled Soft Gripper}

[Short Summary of recycled soft gripper paper by \cite{Partridge2022}, which is used in the current study]
\\\\\\
\subsubsection{Pick-and-Place of Grocery Items Case Study}
Let us consider an automated warehouse, where items are picked from storage crates which then need to be placed in delivery crates for assembling and delivery. 
The items vary in their shape, size and packaging which make the automation challenging. 
Other challenges are constrained and relatively cluttered space to operate on; and fragile or deformable nature of certain items. 
Furthermore, there can be other uncertainties, such as manufacturing inconsistencies; and temporal nature of the fabrics used in the gripper which can lead to degradation of performance. 

In the use case, we consider four \emph{classes} of items: (i) \emph{soft–fragile} items (e.g. cake, bread, strawberry, bayberry), (ii) \emph{soft–non-fragile} items (e.g. sponge), (iii) \emph{hard–fragile} items (e.g. light bulb, egg), (iv) \emph{hard–non-fragile} items (e.g. plastic spoon). 
The objects being picked can be regular-shaped (e.g. sphere, cube, cone, pyramid, cylinder) or irregular-shaped ones (e.g. strawberries).
%Soft finger can conform to the object’s surface with stable grasping and environmental endurance.
The robotic pick-and-place task can be broken down into a pipeline of four main tasks: (i) pre-grasping, (ii) ascension (grasping), (iii) translation (transport), and (iv) descension (placement). 
An example is the grocery use case of Ocado, which is considered as the world's largest online only supermarket \cite{Triantafyllou2019, Sotiropoulos2018}. \\\\\\

\subsubsection{Standards}
While there are no industry standards defined on soft robotic grippers, there are several related standards in the area of rigid robotics which can provide insights into the safe operation of soft grippers. 
%In this subsection, we highlight the main related standards to specifying a soft gripper. 

\emph{Proposed Standard Terminology for Robotic Hands and Associated Performance Metrics} standard provides a set of terminology and associated definition for robotic hands \cite{Falco2018}.\emph{ISO 14539:2000} standard focuses on the functionalities of end effectors and concentrates on grasp type grippers \cite{ISO14539:2000}. It provides terms to describe object handling and terms of functions, structures, and elements of grasp-type grippers. ...


\emph{ISO 10218-1} and \emph{ISO 10218-2} provide safety requirements for industrial robots and their integration.
Meanwhile, \emph{ISO/TS 15066} provides safety requirements for collaborative industrial robot systems and work environment. 
These standards provides insights into the safe operation of a robotic gripper. ...
In service robotics, \emph{ISO 13482 }covers the hazards presented by the robots and devices for applications in non-industrial environments for providing services. \emph{ISO 23482-1} and \emph{ISO 23482-2} standards extend ISO 13482 with guidance and methods that can be used to test personal care robots. ...

\section{Specification of a Soft Gripper}\label{specification-gripper}
Trustworthiness of a soft gripper can be dependent on both functional and non-functional properties, such as predictability, reliability, adaptability and safety. 
These properties are especially significant for a soft gripper in situations such as ...
\emph{Predictability} concerns the ability of a system or component to perform its tasks reliably. ...
\emph{Reliability} is defined as the ``ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time" \cite{ISO24765:2017}. 
\emph{Adaptability} is defined as the ``degree to which a product or system can effectively and efficiently be adapted for different or evolving hardware, software or other operational or usage environments" \cite{ISO24765:2017}. 
\emph{Safety} is defined as an ``expectation that a system does not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health,property, or the environment is endangered" \cite{ISO24765:2017}.

\paragraph{Verifiability} 
The notion of \emph{verifiability} is considered key for improving trustworthiness of an AS (e.g. soft robot) \cite{Mousavi2022}. 
A unified and holistic approach to verifiability will fundamentally change the approach to verification of ASs and it will lead to systems that are by their construction are worthy of our trust. 
The key insight here is that verifiability can be achieved by considering verification early, for example during specification and system design. 
To this end, one can seek to promote verifiability to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. ...

For a system to be {\em verifiable\/}, a person or a tool needs to be able to check its correctness~\cite{ISO24765:2017} with respect to its requirements and specification \cite{Abeywickrama2022}. 
The main challenge is in specifying and designing the system in such a way that this process is made as easy and intuitive as possible.
%
For ASs in particular, specific challenges include 
%
(i) capturing and formalizing requirements including functionality, safety, security, performance and, beyond these, any additional non-functional requirements purely needed to demonstrate trustworthiness; 
%	 
(ii) handling flexibility, adaptation and learning; and 
%
(iii) managing the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of both the AS and the environment it operates in. 

Specifications need to represent the different aspects of the overall system in a way that is natural to domain experts, facilitates modelling and analysis, provides transparency of how the AS works and gives insights into the reasons that motivate its decisions. 
%
To specify for verifiability, a specification framework will need to offer a variety of domain abstractions to represent the diverse, flexible and possibly evolving requirements ASs are expected to satisfy. 
%
Furthermore, the underlying verification framework should connect all these domain abstractions to allow an analysis of their interaction. This is a key challenge in specification for verifiability in ASs.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe above in the context of a soft gripper – how we can consider above i––iii when specifying for trustworthiness for a soft gripper.
	\item Also, how we can provide for domain abstractions...
