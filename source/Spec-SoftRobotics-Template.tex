\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Soft robotics is an emerging technology in which engineers create flexible devices for use in a variety of applications, such as surgery, prosthetics, space exploration, and grocery picking. 
Soft gripping is considered to be the most mature area in soft robotics. 
In order to advance the wide adoption of soft robots, ensuring their trustworthiness is essential. 
\emph{Trust} may vary, as it can be gained and lost over time, and different research disciplines define trust in different ways. 
Autonomous systems (ASs) (e.g. soft robotic systems) are considered \emph{trustworthy} when the design, engineering, and operation of these systems generate positive outcomes and mitigate outcomes which can be harmful~\cite{Naiseh2022}.
Trustworthiness can be dependent on many factors such as: (i) explainability, accountability and understandability to different users; (ii) robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments; (iii) assurance of their design and operation through verification and validation (V\&V) activities; (iv) confidence in their ability to adapt their functionality as required; (v) security against attacks on the systems, users, and deployed environment; (vi) governance and regulation of their design and operation; and (vii) consideration of ethics and human values in their deployment and use~\cite{Naiseh2022}. 

There are various techniques for demonstrating trustworthiness of ASs, such as formal verification at design-time, runtime verification or monitoring, synthesis and test-based methods \cite{Abeywickrama2022}. 
But, common to all these techniques is the need to formulate \emph{specifications}. 	
According to the ISO standard for systems and software engineering vocabulary~\cite{ISO24765:2017}, a \emph{specification} is a detailed formulation that provides a definitive description of a system for the purpose of developing or validating the system. 
However, the soft robotics community has so far provided very little attention to formulating specifications of soft robotic grippers where most existing works only describe some parameters of the end-effectors (e.g. \cite{Hong2022,Bhattacharya2019,Tadakuma2020,Loh2014,Nishikawa2019,Mohan2020}).  

Meanwhile, \emph{verifiability} is considered key for improving trustworthiness, which can be realized by considering verification early as an integral part during specification, and system design \cite{Mousavi2022} where it can be promoted to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. 
Verifiability will essentially lead to systems that are by their construction are worthy of our trust. 
%, and to this end, it can be promoted to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. 
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We provide an extensive specification to ensure trustworthiness of a soft robotic gripper \cite{Partridge2022} with both functional and non-functional requirements, such as reliability, safety, adaptability, predictability, ethics and regulation.
	\item We highlight the importance of promoting \emph{verifiability} as a first-class objective in the design of a soft robotic gripper. 
\end{itemize}
We explore our study using a case study of pick-and-place tasks of grocery items involving a recycled soft gripper \cite{Partridge2022}.

\subsubsection{Recycled Soft Gripper}
%[Short Summary of recycled soft gripper paper by \cite{Partridge2022}, which is used in the current study]
%\textbf{[Alix Partridge to provide this short subsection -- about 300 words]}
%\\\\\\
The soft robotic gripper used within this study is a two-finger fluidic elastomer actuator, measuring 12 x 134 x 6 mm \cite{Partridge2022}. The gripper is fabricated using a two-part moulding process with a fabric constraining layer and comprises a mix of 70\% pristine EcoFlex 00-30 silicone elastomer and 30\% recycled EcoFlex 00-30 granules that are 1 mm to 2 mm in size.%, as detailed in \cite{Partridge2022}. %within Partridge et al. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9762170).  

The operating procedure for the gripper is simple. Upon actuation of the gripper, a positive pressure is introduced to the system that acts to inflate chambers within the gripper body. As the chambers expand, the constraining layer on the base of the gripper prevents expansion of the base of each chamber, while the top of each chamber is free to expand. This differential expansion of top and bottom results in a curving of each chamber, which then leads to an overall curling of the gripper fingers. When vented, this pressure is removed, and the gripper fingers return to a flattened state.

\subsubsection{Standards}
Although no direct industry \emph{standards} have been defined for soft grippers so far, there are several standards in the area of rigid robotics that provide: (i) a set of terminology and definitions for robotic hands and grippers; and (ii) guidance related to safe spaces, speeds and forces a gripping system needs to function. 

In 2000, \emph{ISO 14539:2000} standard targets manipulating of industrial robots, and provides terms to describe object handling and terms of functions, structures, and elements of grasp-type grippers \cite{ISO14539:2000}.
Later, in 2018, a working group under the IEEE Technical Committee for Robotic Hands, Grasping and Manipulation proposed a standard \cite{Falco2018}, which provides a set of terminology and associated definitions for robotic hands. % (see pg. 3 for a definition for soft robotics). 
%It covers terms relevant to defining performance for robotic hands. %\emph{Proposed Standard Terminology for Robotic Hands and Associated Performance Metrics} standard \cite{Falco2018} provides 
%focuses on the functionalities of end effectors and concentrates on grasp type grippers \cite{ISO14539:2000}. It specifically targets manipulating of industrial robots and provides terms to describe object handling and terms of functions, structures, and elements of grasp-type grippers.
\emph{ISO 10218-1} and \emph{ISO 10218-2} standards propose safety requirements for industrial robots and their integration. 
They describe safety guidance related to different spaces associated with a robot application (i.e. maximum, restricted, operating, safeguarded); speed and separation monitoring using detecting zones; and safety functions for end effector force and pressure. In \emph{ISO/TS 15066}, similar guidance is provided with respect to shared spaces of collaborative industrial robot systems.

\subsection{Related Work}\label{relatedwork}
In \cite{Cheng2021}, the authors propose a three-finger soft-rigid gripper actuated by a soft pneumatic actuator for low-damage gripping of fragile and soft objects. 
By conducting a series of static and dynamic gripping tests that use different forces and fingertip displacements, the authors demonstrate the improved \emph{performance} and \emph{adaptability} of their gripper.  %linear-extension 

A new compliant soft robotic gripper for grasping of objects and capping manipulations is proposed in \cite{Liu2021}. This is through the coordination of its three soft fingers and in hand-manipulation. 
The core issue being addressed is \emph{adaptability} that achieves manipulative tolerance and dexterity for manipulating objects of various sizes, shapes, masses, and positions/orientations. 
The grasping tests conducted demonstrate that the soft finger can conform to the object’s surface with stable grasping and environmental endurance. 

In\cite{Chen2018}, the authors synthesize a soft cable-driven gripper by recasting its mechanical design as a topology optimization problem. 
They perform several fatigue, blocking force, and grasping tests to evaluate the \emph{performance} of their gripper.  
The results of the grasping tests reveal that their optimized gripper can handle a large range of unknown objects of different shapes and weights with different grasping modes (i.e. power grips, precision grips and a combination of both).

In another related work \cite{Cai2021}, a pneumatic webbed soft gripper has been developed and evaluated to grasp unstructured and fragile objects. 
The authors present experimental results of grasping delicate objects (e.g. egg, strawberry, candy and knife) to demonstrate the \emph{safety} and \emph{adaptability} of their webbed soft gripper. % for fragile and crisp objects.

A reinforced soft gripper is proposed in \cite{Hwang2020} with a mechanically strengthened electro adhesion pad and a multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuator. This soft gripper has two fingers and it can grasp various shapes of objects, such as hexahedral, spherical, cylindrical, and flat structures; thus demonstrating \emph{adaptability}. Also, the gripper with a mass of 6.2 g, could hold up and move objects weighing 625 g. 

In \cite{Shin2021}, the authors propose a soft gripper for smart manufacturing that improves on the Fin Ray finger with enhanced gripping capability. The \emph{performance} as in gripping weight of the modified finger has been improved by 40\%. The authors perform gripping tests for a total of 17 types of both rigid and soft objects.

As discussed, most existing works (e.g. \cite{Cheng2021,Liu2021,Chen2018,Cai2021,Hwang2020,Shin2021}) describe improving \emph{adaptability} or \emph{performance} of a soft gripper. However, these works do not cover a broad range of properties for trustworthiness, as considered in our study. %one or two trustworthiness properties of a soft gripper like 
Furthermore, most existing approaches (e.g. \cite{Hong2022,Bhattacharya2019,Tadakuma2020,Loh2014,Nishikawa2019,Mohan2020}) only describe some parameters of the end-effector, and no work proposes a wide-ranging specification for trustworthiness.%, as proposed in our study.

\subsection{Case Study: Pick-and-Place tasks of Grocery Items}
%Let us consider an automated warehouse, where items are picked from storage crates which then need to be placed in delivery crates for assembling and delivery. 
%The items vary in their shape, size, orientation and packaging which make the automation challenging. 
%Other challenges are constrained and relatively cluttered space to operate on; and fragile or deformable nature of certain items. 
%Furthermore, there can be the presence of other uncertainties, such as manufacturing inconsistencies; and temporal nature of the fabrics used in the gripper which can lead to degradation of performance. 
Let us consider an automated warehouse, where items are picked from storage crates which are then placed in delivery crates for assembling and delivery. 
There are several uncertainties that contribute to making the automation challenging: (i) items can vary in their shape, size, packaging, and orientation; (ii) fragile or deformable nature of certain items; (iii) constrained and relatively cluttered space to operate on; (iv) manufacturing inconsistencies; and (v) temporal nature of the fabrics used in the gripper which can lead to performance degradation. 

In the use case, we consider four \emph{classes} of items: (i) \emph{soft–fragile} items (e.g. cake, bread, strawberry, bayberry), (ii) \emph{soft–non-fragile} items (e.g. sponge), (iii) \emph{hard–fragile} items (e.g. light bulb, egg), (iv) \emph{hard–non-fragile} items (e.g. plastic spoon). 
The objects being picked can be regular-shaped (e.g. sphere, cube, cone, pyramid, cylinder) or irregular-shaped ones (e.g. strawberries).
%Soft finger can conform to the object’s surface with stable grasping and environmental endurance.
The robotic pick-and-place task can be structured into a pipeline of four main tasks: (i) pre-grasping, (ii) ascension (grasping), (iii) translation (transport), and (iv) descension (placement). 
An example is the grocery use case of Ocado, which is considered as the world's largest online only supermarket \cite{Triantafyllou2019, Sotiropoulos2018}.

% Modeling of a Soft-Rigid Gripper Actuated by a Linear-Extension Soft Pneumatic Actuator

%For achieving low-damage gripping to the object in static gripping system, we proposed a soft-rigidgripper actuated by a linear-extension soft pneumatic actuator in this study.
%
%Based on such studies, we proposed a soft-rigid gripper actuated by a linear-extension soft pneumatic actuator used in a static gripping system.
%
%In this study, we developed a three finger gripper with a built-in linear-extension soft pneumatic actuator and a slider link mechanism, as shown in Figure 1a.
%
%We proposed a soft-rigid gripper, which was actuated by a linear-extension softpneumatic actuator composed of a metal spring wound on the outer wall of a cylindricalsilicone cavity
%
%
%Furthermore,the low damage gripping to fragile and soft objects in static and dynamic gripping tests showed goodperformance of the gripper. Overall, the results indicated the potential application of the gripper inpick-and-place operations.
%
%Static gripping test:
%Before the gripping test, a pre-experimentwas conducted to test the minimum gripping force and fingertip displacement requiredfor the gripper to stably lift the above objects. The resulted values would be as the safethresholds of the gripping force and fingertip displacement.

%Dynamic gripping test:
%In addition to proving the static gripping performance of the gripper in Section 5.4,we conducted an experiment to further demonstrate that the gripper has certain dynamicgripping ability for vulnerable objects in Figure 14.

%%Soft Robotic Gripper Driven by Flexible Shafts for Simultaneous Grasping and In-Hand Cap Manipulation
%This study presents a new compliant soft robotic gripper for objects handling and cap manipulation through the coordination of three soft fingers and in-hand manipulation. 
%The experiments are conducted to validate that the soft robotic gripper can successfully realize simultaneous grasping and capping manipulations with only one flexible shaft actuation for every single soft finger.
%ROBOTIC grippers interacting with unstructured tasks experience a core issue, that is, adaptability [1]. A robotic gripper with adaptability realizes manipulative tolerance and dexterity for manipulating objects with various sizes, shapes,masses, and positions/orientations.
%Main contributions: 
%1) A robotic gripper consists of soft fingers that achieve in-hand simultaneous exertion of bending and tangential force/torque and can exhibit environment tolerance, such as impact and puncture.
%2) A soft finger is controlled by a single flexible shaft to achieve bending and twisting DoFs, which are essential for the simultaneous exertion of grasping and in-hand capping manipulation.

%Fig. 9 shows the utility of the soft robotic gripper ingrasping different objects. The objects involved have variousshapes, masses, and sizes, and are used every day, as shownin Fig. 9(b)–(h). An irregular object being grabbed at the palmof the robotic gripper is released later on by the soft fingers.Each task was conducted five times, and all grasps wereaccomplished. Fig. 9(i)–(k) shows the different directionaldisturbance forces on the objects (cup, bottled water, andglossy glass bottle) that are power-grasped (see an experimentalvideo in the supplementary materials). The experimentsdemonstrated that the soft robotic gripper could successfullygrasp different objects with various shapes, masses, and sizes.The soft finger can conform to the object’s surface with stablegrasping and environmental endurance. The specification ofthe grasps on objects is presented in Table II.The performance of the loosening capped object is evaluatedto verify the twisting capability of the soft robotic gripper.The robotic gripper performs uncapping manipulation on acapped cup through the cooperation of the three soft fingers.

%Pneumatic Webbed Soft Gripper for Unstructured Grasping
%In this study, a pneumatic webbed soft gripper to grasp unstructured and fragile objects was developed and evaluated. 
%Inspired by duck foot and octopus tentacle, a pneumatic webbed soft gripper was proposed, which is consisted of four multi-chambered fingers and four webs. 
%Figure shows the experimental results of grasping delicate objects of egg, strawberry, candy and knife. 
%The successful grasping of egg and strawberry demonstrated the safety and adaptability of the webbed soft gripper for fragile and crisp objects, especially food and agricultural products.

%
%This work tried to develop a soft gripper that can hold multiplediminutive objects in one snatch and improve the stability andreliability of grasping. The study proposed a four-finger webbedsoft gripper and focused on the design, fabrication, and control.The design inspiration came from the structure of the flippers ofducks, i.e., adding webs to the traditional soft fingers to wrap theobjects when grasping them. The webbed soft gripper caneffectively prevent the gripped objects from falling off from thegaps between the fingers, and reduce the precision requirements ofthe capture operation, which greatly improves the success rate andreliability of grasping.

%Figure 15 shows the experimental results of grasping delicateobjects of egg, strawberry, candy and knife. The successfulgrasping of egg and strawberry demonstrated the safety andadaptability of the webbed soft gripper for fragile and crisp objects,especially food and agricultural products. For the candy graspingexperiment, 50 times grasping were executed for a pile of candiesin a basket, as shown in Figure 15c. On average, there were 4candies grabbed for each try, which can hardly be realized withoutthe web. The packing effects of the web were also demonstratedby grasping the versatile knife without precise orientation orposition, as shown in Figure 15d.

%Mechanically Strengthened Electroadhesion based Soft Gripper with Multi-layered Dielectric Elastomer Actuator
%In \cite{Hwang2020}, the authors introduce a reinforced soft gripper with a mechanically strengthened electro adhesion pad and a multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuator, for a practical robotic application... In 

%With this study, we demonstrate dynamic pickingand placing tasks with the proposed gripper assembled in arobotic system.
%
%
%In this paper, we propose a reinforced soft grippercomposed of a mechanically strengthened electroadhesionpad and a multi-layered DE bending actuator. Theelectroadhesion pad is comprised of a metallic electrodepattern printed on thin polyimide film. This polyimide film isflexible but has a very high elastic modulus compared withtypical soft materials for a DE gripper, such aspolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and acrylic elastomer.Moreover, to increase the bending force which is used forgrasping, a multi-layered DE actuator has been applied to aunimorph structure. In addition, a uniform deformation of theproposed gripper is induced by an aligned metallic electrodepattern and expansion of the DE actuator layers.For maximizing the performance of the proposed grippersystem, we optimized the electrode pattern in aspects of thethickness of the insulation layer. In addition, we analyzed thenumber of layers of the multi-layered DE actuator. Finally,the proposed soft gripper practically picks up and placesobjects of various shapes weighing up to 625 g, for a realrobotic application.
%
%
%The soft gripper is composed of two soft fingers, whichare designed based on the process above. This soft grippercan hold up various shapes of target objects, includinghexahedral, spherical, cylindrical, and flat structures
%
%These results confirm that the designed softgripper can be widely used to pick and place random objectsthanks to its adaptability, stability and high capability.

\paragraph{Reliability}\label{reliability}
\emph{Reliability} is defined as the ``ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time" \cite{ISO24765:2017}. A soft gripper needs to be reliable in its functionality by not dropping or damaging items during pick-and-place tasks, and should be tolerant to graceful degradation of performance.

\emph{Adaptability} is defined as the ``degree to which a product or system can effectively and efficiently be adapted for different or evolving hardware, software or other operational or usage environments" \cite{ISO24765:2017}. In a soft gripper, \emph{adaptability} is key for manipulating objects of various sizes, shapes, masses, and positions/orientations.

%			\textbf{Reqt.} & \textbf{Verification technique} \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.1 & Just a test. visual inspection. if finger does not curve there is leakage...  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.2 & Just a test. visual inspection.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.3 & Unite test (test one finger in paper...fig 7 thats what the unit test we do...performance unit testing).  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.4 & Subjective. it is better if we follow a specific equation first. better to cite a paper.. have not seen exactly. if this is just for recycled soft gripper i will check alex paper.. 5 to 10 inflatable cycles.. alex has a paper. may be you can reference alex paper - he has a paper...tries to find.. verification tech - unit test to check the (11:20 said will send it) \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.5 & test in the paper. optimal pressure range fingers would curve into desired curvature. Block test. Or call it a unit test.. hang on isometric test is testing the strength.. don't use that term. just use unit test or block test... Figure 7a..  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ1.6 & just pump operational range. no test we just follow the specification of the pump...and pump will not work beyond... pump manufacturer would already verified that   \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.1 & Inspection as well.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.2 & Visually inspecting. Inspect as well. data recording and repeated test  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.3 & Testing and trying errors. You have upper bound. you try upper bound and see if it works. Verification - Edge cases test (extreme test). It is still operational under extreme cases. step it up until max value and outside that value it does not work as expected. out of bound. checking upper bound and lower bound and edge cases. doing tests...  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.4 & Inspection, you see if it grasp the object or not.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.5 & Material dependent (silicon). Doing in cycle. what is the degradation rate you expect. relates to 95\% one. if it is less than 95 it become unsuable. that is what you have to test for. .from same test measure data (degradation of performance... benchmark.. deviate .. don't work .. affect successful operation. need to replace it)  And later say for example is like. Basically you can see the decoration of the performance, meaning that it doesn't really perform. So for example, you've got a benchmark of. It's always curve, not much when the pressure pumped it is this X amount, right? But then as it degrades, not gonna curve that exactly like that anymore, but it would deviate from that. It's either more or less. So if it deviate.
%			Uh. Outside a certain range, it doesn't work at expected anymore and that then we will say and then at that number will affect the successful right of operation a bit as well.
%			And that if it fall out of that range, then you say, yeah, it's it's not usable anymore. You need to replace it. ... correct - if you cant grasp and drops in 10 sec it is not a functional gripper anymore
%			\\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ2.6 &   \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ3.1 & long term repeating test. traditional one.. inspection observation .. may be graham might know. life span of a piece of equipment. life span test. it is a test. manufacturer do. LIFE CYCLE TESTING... this could be for degradation. for this variety testing of different categories. physical testing, observing and recording - dhaminda.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ3.2 & Inspection.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ3.3 & ... same as 3.1 repeated variety test as well. also 3.4  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.1 & you can build this by vision camera to check whether it is moving or not, or just inspect. but a motion, camera will tell you exactly, so it'll be mounted one on somewhere, either on robot arm and effects or whatever. I'll be able to tell you, or just just outside it within the robot workspace, mounting it somewhere.. even inspection is Ok.  \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.2 & More like, you know, tactile sensor, force torque sensor reading. Because this comes back to it not being damaged, the item right, so it has to be appropriate force being applied. So you can build that into your force torque sensor. This sensor is used -, the forced to see whether it's colliding with the item, right. \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.3 & The gripping system shall only made contact with the item using the gripper. Yeah, that's basically comes down to, you know, the force torque sensor or the load cell being applied on the gripper and on the rest of the arm. Just check that. So tactile sensing will tell you these information. force torque sensor and vision (camera). Put together. \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.4 & capability test or functional test (functional test - functional test is basically testing whether is perform a specific function). Measure in Newtons - could use load cell for this on to the gripper and  then basically  just keep inflating the gripper until you crossed it and then that's the force.. keep increasing the force until it reached like a critical Max force that break the thing. Uh, we call it test to failure, but then when it breaks and you know that you can't accept that. Test to failure: it is normally they  do it in tensile testing when it stretch a piece of material or they pull a piece of material until it breaks and that will be the the maximal, the maximum force that piece of material can take. This is not a Tensile test but it is a function test. But it has the same principle. 
%			 \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.5 & fingertip displacement - proximity sensor.It's sort of like measuring like the deviation distance...correct -- displacement sensor would tell you one thing has displaced. So displacement sensor will tell you how much.
%			One thing's been displaced by   \\ 
%			\hline
%			RQ4.5 & both sensor -- either displacement sensor, vission camera. Yeah. And then you either displacement sensor, you can use vision camera also tell you this as well so. Yeah, but but then you don't want to over. Uh, complicated your system so displacement sensor would. Brought out of finger tape will tell you this information. \\ \hline

%pressure and volume 4a) unit test or functional test- this is how you would do that. this one is a different functional test ..38:00 process is same. 1.5, 1.6... test setup is very similar to 

%Meanwhile, \emph{verifiability} is considered key for improving trustworthiness, which can be realized by considering verification early as an integral part during specification, and system design \cite{Mousavi2022} where it can be promoted to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. 
%Verifiability will essentially lead to systems that are by their construction are worthy of our trust. 




The notion of \emph{verifiability} is considered key for improving trustworthiness of an AS (e.g. soft robot) \cite{Mousavi2022}. 
A unified and holistic approach to verifiability will fundamentally change the approach to verification of ASs, which will lead to systems that are by their construction are worthy of our trust. 
Verifiability can be achieved by considering verification early, such as during specification and system design \cite{Mousavi2022} where it can be promoted to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. 
%To this end, one can seek to promote verifiability to a first-class system design objective \cite{Eder2021}. ...


System engineers need to design the system for \emph{verifiability}, as the ultimate purpose of specifications is verifying that the end product exhibits the intended properties \cite{Gerson1993}. 
This requires the intended properties to be \emph{demonstrable}, i.e. that knowledge of the end result needs to be attainable. 
In our study, we have considered how these properties need to be verified during 

this how we will demonstrate these properties during the requirements elicitation process (see Table~\ref{Table:Verifiability}). 
%Avoiding negative requirements and including numerical tolerances are not the only means of writing requirements for verifiability. 


For a system to be {\em verifiable\/}, a person or a tool needs to be able to check its correctness~\cite{ISO24765:2017} with respect to its requirements and specification \cite{Abeywickrama2022}. 
The main challenge is in specifying and designing the system in such a way that this process is made as easy and intuitive as possible.
%
For ASs in particular, specific challenges include 
%
(i) capturing and formalizing requirements including functionality, safety, security, performance and, beyond these, any additional non-functional requirements purely needed to demonstrate trustworthiness; 
%	 
(ii) handling flexibility, adaptation and learning; and 
%
(iii) managing the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of both the AS and the environment it operates in. 
The properties we specified in previous subsection are intended to address above i--iii challenges. 

While most requirements in the specification are {\em verifiable\/}, still some requirements are abstract in nature. 
For example, ....
%In this subsection, we will discuss how we propose to make the requirements verifiable (raw requirements to verifiable requirements, and explain the delta)...

%are both functional and non-functional (thus, supporting i), and the adaptability requirements support ii
%In the previous subsection, we provided a set of functional and non-functional requirements 

%Specifications need to represent the different aspects of the overall system in a way that is natural to domain experts, facilitates modelling and analysis, provides transparency of how the AS works and gives insights into the reasons that motivate its decisions. 
%%
%To specify for verifiability, a specification framework will need to offer a variety of domain abstractions to represent the diverse, flexible and possibly evolving requirements ASs are expected to satisfy. 
%%
%Furthermore, the underlying verification framework should connect all these domain abstractions to allow an analysis of their interaction. This is a key challenge in specification for verifiability in ASs.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Describe above in the context of a soft gripper – how we can consider above i––iii when specifying for trustworthiness for a soft gripper.
%	\item Also, how we can provide for domain abstractions...

%
%Verification should be raised to a design concern, which is what verifiability is about.
