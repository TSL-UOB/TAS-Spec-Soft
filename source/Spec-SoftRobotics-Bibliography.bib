	abstract = {Abstract Efforts to develop autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) have exploded across a range of settings in recent years, from self-driving cars to medical diagnostic chatbots. These have the potential to bring enormous benefits to society but also have the potential to introduce new—or amplify existing—risks. As these emerging technologies become more widespread, one of the most critical risk management challenges is to ensure that failures of AIS can be rigorously analyzed and understood so that the safety of these systems can be effectively governed and improved. AIS are necessarily developed and deployed within complex human, social, and organizational systems, but to date there has been little systematic examination of the sociotechnical sources of risk and failure in AIS. Accordingly, this article develops a conceptual framework that characterizes key sociotechnical sources of risk in AIS by reanalyzing one of the most publicly reported failures to date: the 2018 fatal crash of Uber's self-driving car. Publicly available investigative reports were systematically analyzed using constant comparative analysis to identify key sources and patterns of sociotechnical risk. Five fundamental domains of sociotechnical risk were conceptualized—structural, organizational, technological, epistemic, and cultural—each indicated by particular patterns of sociotechnical failure. The resulting SOTEC framework of sociotechnical risk in AIS extends existing theories of risk in complex systems and highlights important practical and theoretical implications for managing risk and developing infrastructures of learning in AIS.},

	abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this paper is to describe recent requirements verification experiences and offer hindsights on designing requirements for verifiability. With the advent of concurrent engineering and multi-disciplinary product development teams, hardware designers must “design for manufacturability.” Systems Engineers must “design for verifiability,” keeping in mind the ultimate purpose of requirements and specifications: verifying that the end product exhibits the intended properties. Composite case examples are drawn from various programs in the space systems domain to illustrate the concepts of perceptiveness, observability, verification methods, environmental factors, safety, etc. Epistemological concepts of sufficient proof, validity of evidence, and degree of rigor are invoked in the interest of philosophical consistency, cost savings, and quality improvement. Specific case examples center on tasks such as the following: Verifying that the power subsystem will support vehicle loads for a specified time; verifying that the vehicle will survive in a contingency mode for a specified time, and verifying proper operation, integration, and installation of a backup attitude control subsystem. Tradeoffs are discussed between requirements design and the resulting impacts on analysis and test processes. Techniques are discussed for bounding the verification task, prioritizing effort, ensuring discipline (traceability), and breaking down high-level requirements into verifiable portions.},

	abstract="Because no single technique is adequate to cover a whole system in practice, a variety of complementary techniques will be needed to gain confidence in the trustworthiness of robotic and autonomous systems. In this chapter, we argue that demonstrable trustworthiness can be achieved by design, through transparency and by rigorous verification and validation. We then concentrate on ensuring correctness during system development, with specific focus on how to achieve implementations that are free from runtime errors and how design flaws can be detected prior to implementation. Our discussion is illustrated on two examples, robot navigation code and Simulink controllers. In both cases, the power of fully automatic theorem proving combined with test-based techniques can deliver strong confidence in system correctness. Attention is then turned to simulation-based verification, focusing in particular on the test generation challenge. We motivate the benefits of introducing agency into the test environment and show how exploiting multi-agent systems for test generation can lead to robust tests that achieve a high level of coverage as part of a coverage-driven verification methodology. Finally, some challenges for robotic and autonomous system verification are discussed, including specification, (more) automation, discipline, innovation and creativity in combining techniques and exploiting AI for verification.",

	ABSTRACT = {Soft robot has been one significant study in recent decades and soft gripper is one of the popular research directions of soft robot. In a static gripping system, excessive gripping force and large deformation are the main reasons for damage of the object during the gripping process. For achieving low-damage gripping to the object in static gripping system, we proposed a soft-rigid gripper actuated by a linear-extension soft pneumatic actuator in this study. The characteristic of the gripper under a no loading state was measured. When the pressure was &gt;70 kPa, there was an approximately linear relation between the pressure and extension length of the soft actuator. To achieve gripping force and fingertip displacement control of the gripper without sensors integrated on the finger, we presented a non-contact sensing method for gripping state estimation. To analyze the gripping force and fingertip displacement, the relationship between the pressure and extension length of the soft actuator in loading state was compared with the relationship under a no-loading state. The experimental results showed that the relative error between the analytical gripping force and the measured gripping force of the gripper was &le;2.1%. The relative error between analytical fingertip displacement and theoretical fingertip displacement of the gripper was &le;7.4%. Furthermore, the low damage gripping to fragile and soft objects in static and dynamic gripping tests showed good performance of the gripper. Overall, the results indicated the potential application of the gripper in pick-and-place operations.},
